Some idiot forgot to disarm a bomb that is laid in the 'decomisioned' bomb pile.
Unfortunately the only way to tell which bomb is armed is to use a special weighing system.
To add insult to injury we don't know if the armed bomb weighs less or more on the system just that it weighs differently.
But there is yet another catch the weighing system only have two charges left, but it can weight any number of bombs at once.
Your job is to tell which 1 bomb out of the 9 bombs is armed while only using the weighing machine twice.


Answer:
       For the first charge, you weigh 3 and 3 on each side of the scale.
       If they're different, weigh the heavier set of three for the next
       charge. If they're the same, weigh the unweighted bombs for the second charge.
       Weigh 1 bomb on each side of the scale leaving one bomb unweighted. If
       they're different, the heavier bomb is armed. If they're the same, the unweighted bomb is armed.

The Shoe Shack has made several top-dollar sales today. 
Using only the clues below, match each customer to their foot size, 
shoe brand and final purchase price.

No option in any category will ever be used more than once.  

1. The $185 pair was 4 sizes smaller than Natalie's pair.
2. The Cormano footwear was somewhat smaller than the Williford footwear.
3. The Schtillet footwear was somewhat larger than Marie's pair.
4. The $125 pair was somewhat larger than Marie's pair.
5. Lucia's pair wasn't made by Tinghill.
6. Of the $185 pair and the size 9 set, one was bought by Francine and the other was by Graffetz.
7. The $245 pair wasn't made by Tinghill.
8. The $260 pair was 2 sizes larger than Vanessa's pair.
9. The Williford footwear was 1 size smaller than Francine's pair.
10. The $125 pair was 2 sizes smaller than Ruth's pair.
11. The $215 pair was 5 sizes smaller than the $170 pair.
12. The $185 pair was 2 sizes smaller than Lucia's pair.
13. The Schtillet footwear was either Ruth's pair or the size 5 set.
14. The Abbott Hill footwear was 5 sizes larger than the $215 pair.
15. The Williford footwear was 1 size smaller than the $245 pair.

Solution:

| Shoe Sizes | Customers | Brands      | Prices |
|          4 |     Marie |    Graffetz |   $185 |
|          5 |   Vanessa |   Schtillet |   $215 |

* TODO Exercises
In 01-ponder do every third exercise. 
That is if you start at the first or 1st then you need to do 4th,
but if you start at 3rd then you need to do the 6th.

You must put them in this file!

  What other special forms besides =if= does elisp have for doing conditionals?
  Why are they called \ldquo{}special\rdquo?
:HINT:
  - Hint :: You can find at least six.

  1.) =and=

  What is the set difference between the set of letters in the English alphabet
  and the set of letters in the Hawaiian alphabet?
#+end_note

  The difference between the letters in the two alphabets is that the Hawaiian alphabet is made up of thirteen
  letters, 5 vowels and 8 consonants.
     Additionally, the set difference is B C D F G J Q R S T V X Y Z.

  Here is a setq chain ilustrating subsetsize compared to superset size:

  (setq A [s i z e]
        a 4
        B [b i g g e r i n s i z e]
        b 12
        A-is-a-subset-of-B t
        a-is-less-than-or-equal-to-b t)

  Write or find built-in functions so that you can revise this chain of
  assignments to avoid literals 4, 12 and t,
  instead replacing them with function calls.
#+end_note

  Use funcall or apply to find the cardinallity of A and B.
  To avoid t we need to write a defun to iterate through both list.
